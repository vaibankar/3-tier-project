Part 0: Setup
For this workshop, we will be downloading the code from Github and upload it to S3 so our instances can access it. We will also create an AWS Identity and Access Management EC2 role so we can use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to connect to our instances securely and without needing to create SSH key pairs.

Learning Objectives:
S3 Bucket Creation
IAM EC2 Instance Role Creation
Download the code from this repository  into your local environment by running the command below.
If you don't have git installed, you can just download the zip. Save it somewhere you can easily access.
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-three-tier-web-architecture-workshop.git
S3 Bucket Creation
Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS console and create a new S3 bucket.

Give it a unique name, and then leave all the defaults as in. Make sure to select the region that you intend to run this whole lab in. This bucket is where we will upload our code later.
